## About the English Playbills Collection

The [University of Alberta Library](https://library.ualberta.ca/) acquired this collection of historic theatre playbills for study and research in the Department of Drama between the late 1960s and the early 1980s. This collection helps to document many of the performances staged in the major playhouses in the United Kingdom from 1779 to 1902, with the bulk of them from 1804 to 1885. It provides a wealth of information about dramatic performances, ranging from the plays, playwrights, and actors to theatres, dates, and ticket prices. It is of potential interest not only for the study of drama but also for the study of book history and graphic design. 

This collection was digitized in 2019 by the University of Alberta Library and hosted on the Internet Archive platform. A student created item-level metadata. For this demo site, the location data (longitude and latitude) was made but not verified and may not be accurate.  

### How can I see one of the playbills in person? 
To view materials held in Bruce Peel Special Collections, please write to us at bpsc@ualberta.ca to request an appointment well in advance, listing the requested materials and indicating which weekday afternoons would work.
